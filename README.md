# Acute Myeloid Leukemia Heatmap

This analysis has been adapted from this [refine.bio-examples notebook](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/03-rnaseq/clustering_rnaseq_01_heatmap.html)

## Purpose of the analysis

In this analysis, we will use this [acute myeloid leukemia sample dataset](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/SRP070849) from [Shih et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28193779/) and pre-processed by [refinebio](https://www.refine.bio/). The data that we downloaded from [refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/) for this analysis has 19 samples (obtained from 19 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model mice), containing RNA-sequencing results for types of AML under controlled treatment conditions.

This [dataset can be downloaded from this page on refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/SRP070849). We will download it already [processed and quantile normalized](http://docs.refine.bio/en/latest/main_text.html#refine-bio-processed-refinebio-processedibadge).
